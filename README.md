# Astro + TailwindCSS + TypeScript Starter for GitHub Pages

This is a starter project configured with:

*   **Astro**: The web framework for building fast, content-focused websites.
*   **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
*   **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript for type safety.
*   **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Automated deployment via GitHub Actions.
*   **Devcontainer**: Ready-to-use development environment with VS Code Dev Containers.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/.
â”œâ”€â”€ .devcontainer/       # Devcontainer configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ devcontainer.json
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/             # GitHub Actions workflows
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ workflows/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ deploy.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ global.css
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.mjs
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`        |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview your build locally before deploying      |
| `npm run astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro check`  | Run diagnostics to check for issues in your code |

## âœ… Getting Started

1.  **Open in Devcontainer**: If using VS Code, open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and select "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container". This will build and start the development environment defined in `.devcontainer/`.
2.  **Install Dependencies**: The `postCreateCommand` in `devcontainer.json` should automatically run `npm install`. If not, run it manually in the container's terminal.
3.  **Start Developing**: Run `npm run dev` to start the local development server.

## GitHub Pages Configuration

*   The `astro.config.mjs` file is pre-configured with `site` and `base` options assuming your repository will be at `https://<username>.github.io/<reponame>/`. **Remember to update `<username>` and `<reponame>` in `astro.config.mjs`** to match your GitHub username and repository name.
*   The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will automatically build and deploy your site to the `gh-pages` branch upon pushing to `main`.
*   You need to **enable GitHub Pages** in your repository settings, choosing the `gh-pages` branch as the source.
